# Project Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:

# Part 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights**
**Aim:** The goal of this part is to scrape review data from the web, focusing specifically on reviews about the airline itself. The collected data will be used for analysis and to uncover insights about the airline's performance.

**Steps:**

**Data Collection:** The data is collected from a platform called **SkyTrax** the houses a large amount of airline related data.The data collected include as much information as possible to improve the output of the analysis.
**Data Cleaning:** Once the dataset is collected, we perform data cleaning to prepare the data for analysis. The data was expected to be messy and contain purely text. 
**Data Analysis:** We perform an analysis of the cleaned data to uncover insights. Some suggested starting points for analysis included topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds to provide insight into the content of the reviews.

# Part 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior
**Aim:** In this part, the goal is to explore and prepare the dataset for building a predictive model that can predict a customer's likelihood of making a booking.

**Steps:**

**Dataset Exploration:** We begin this process by exploring the dataset using the Jupyter Notebook provided .
**Dataset Preparation:** We prepare the dataset for building the predictive model. Considered creating new features that can enhance the model's predictive capabilities. The provided Resources can be used as a starting point for this task.
**Model Training:** Once the data is ready, we trained a machine learning model to predict the target outcome, which is whether a customer makes a booking or not. We used algorithms like RandomForest to provide insights into how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. 

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the trained model by conducting cross-validation and calculating appropriate evaluation metrics.
